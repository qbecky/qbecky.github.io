A trefoil lamp assembled from developable surface strips. This C-tube has been optimized to perfectly align the triangular profiles at the start and end point of the input trefoil curve in a way that results in a single developable surface strip for the whole model. This strip is cut into segments for fabrication as shown on the left. The photos show the physical model with an interior light from different viewpoints.
